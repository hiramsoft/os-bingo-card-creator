            <h2>What are Bingo Cards?</h2>
            <p>
                Bingo is a game of chance played with randomly drawn numbers which players match against numbers that have been pre-printed on 5Ã—5 matrices. The matrices may be printed on paper or card stock, or electronically represented, and are referred to as cards. Many versions conclude the game when the first person achieves a specified pattern from the drawn numbers. The winner is usually required to call out the word "Bingo!", which alerts the other players and caller of a possible win. All wins are checked for accuracy before the win is officially confirmed at which time the prize is secured and a new game is begun. In this version of bingo, players compete against one another for the prize or jackpot.

            <h2>What does One Step Bingo Card Creator do?</h2>
            <p>
                The One Step Bingo Card creates your own personalized bingo cards based on your word lists. Using your own word lists, simply click a button to generate a card, then print.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can do it as many times as you like generating as many bingo cards as you want. All cards are created randomly so you will get a different card every time.
            </p>

            <h2>How much does One Step Bingo Card Creator cost?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a <strong>free service</strong> and <strong>does not require registration</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One Step Bingo Card Creator runs locally in your browser and does not transmit or download
                data from any servers.  As such, we incur no no costs when you use the service and therefore have
                no incentive to charge you.
            </p>

            <h2>How does the word list work?</h2>
            <p>
                Your word list is all of the possible answers for bingo.  They may be individual words, numbers, or short phrases that fit within the grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a word list, type potential words or phrases, one per line, into the textbox.  One Step Bingo Card Creator will
                randomly select and place each of your words or phrase across as many bingo cards as you wish.
            </p>

            <h2>How does One Step Bingo Card Creator differ from others?</h2>
            <p>
                There are four big differences:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Price and Registration</li>
                <li>100% Private</li>
                <li>Print-ready PDFs</li>
                <li>Branding-free</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Price and Registration</h4>
            <p>
                Some competitors charge as much as $30.00 USD to generate bingo card PDFs.  We charge $0.00 USD.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some competitors require you to log in with a username and password to get "free" bingo cards.  We do not.
            </p>

            <h4>100% Private</h4>
            <p>
                One Step Bingo Card Creator runs completely within your browser, using local JavaScript to compute and generate
                the PDF Bing Cards.  This means that all data stays in your browser and we have zero costs to operate
                the service, regardless of how many bingo cards you create.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some competitors claim your data is safe and secure, or they point to privacy policies guaranteeing your protection.  They still have your word lists, and you have to trust them to be stewards.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't collect your data at all.  All your data stays in the browser.
            </p>

            <h4>Print-ready PDFs</h4>
            <p>
                Some competitors output HTML tables and ask you to print web pages.  The formatting is never <em>quite</em> right.  We generate PDFs that print the same way, every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can print these PDFs either at a local inket printer or send them to your print shop for cost-effective batch runs.
            </p>
            <h4>Branding-free</h4>
            <p>
                Some competitors put their brands on <em>your</em> bingo cards as a form of advertising.  We do not.  The only hard-coded, "required" text on One Step Bingo Cards is the word "BINGO".  We hope this makes the bingo cards appropriate and accessible for as many people as possible.
            </p>

            <h2>How does US Copyright Law work with One Step Bingo Card Creator?</h2>

            <h2>What is your privacy policy?</h2>
            <p>
                There is a detailed privacy policy that covers all of Hiram Software, but in general with One Step Bingo Card
                Creator no data is sent to any server about your word lists or number of boards.  We don't collect any of your

            </p>

            <h2>What is the difference between American letter and European A4?</h2>
            <p>
                "American letter" is the most common paper size used in the United States.  It often is called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_%28paper_size%29">letter</a>" size and is different from "legal" size.  We use the adjective American to suggest where this format is most common.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, "European A4" is actually an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216#A_series">international standard</a> that is the most common paper size used in Europe.  We use the adjective European similarly to suggest the format's base of support, but we recognize that it is not only used in Europe.
            </p>

            <h2>What limitations should I know about?</h2>
            <p>
                Currently One Step Bingo Card Creator does not support full UTF-8 characters.  This is a
                browser-based limitation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact is if your vocab words are in Chinese or another language that depends heavily on UTF-8,
                you will not see your boards rendered correctly.
            </p>

            <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
            <p>
                We had bingo cards at our wedding as a way to mix different groups of friends, and it was maddening to me how terrible or overpriced all the alternatives we could find were.  We used the most popular competitor at the time, and we were generally unhappy with the process.  Our guests loved the game!
            </p>
            <p>
                One day I wanted to see if it were possible to make a free version targeting educators and other professionals.  It seemed to work in modern browsers, and by making this work 100% within the web browser, it is possible to make this 100% free for you to use.
